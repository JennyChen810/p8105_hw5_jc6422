## Question 1

Write a function

``` r
shared_birthday = function(n) {
  birthdays = sample(1:365, n, replace = TRUE)
  return(any(duplicated(birthdays)))
}
```

Run this function 10000 times for each group size between 2 and 50.

``` r
group_sizes = 2:50
simulations = 10000

results = 
  tibble(group_size = group_sizes) %>%
  mutate(
    output_lists = map(group_size, ~rerun(simulations, shared_birthday(.x))),
    estimate_df = map(output_lists, ~tibble(shared_birthday = unlist(.)))
     )%>%
  select(-output_lists) %>%
  unnest(estimate_df) %>%
  group_by(group_size) %>%
  summarize(probability = mean(shared_birthday), .groups = 'drop')
```

    ##   # Previously
    ##   rerun(10000, shared_birthday(.x))
    ## 
    ##   # Now
    ##   map(1:10000, ~ shared_birthday(.x))

``` r
results
```

    ## # A tibble: 49 × 2
    ##    group_size probability
    ##         <int>       <dbl>
    ##  1          2      0.0034
    ##  2          3      0.0092
    ##  3          4      0.0174
    ##  4          5      0.0258
    ##  5          6      0.0379
    ##  6          7      0.0537
    ##  7          8      0.0738
    ##  8          9      0.0939
    ##  9         10      0.121 
    ## 10         11      0.139 
    ## # ℹ 39 more rows

Make a plot showing the probability as a function of group size.

``` r
results %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = group_size, y = probability)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Probability of Shared Birthday vs Group Size",
       x = "Group Size",
       y = "Probability of Shared Birthday") +
  theme_minimal()
```

This plot shows the relationship between the probability of shared
birthday and group size, as the group size increases, the probability of
at least two people sharing a birthday rises rapidly. This growth is
nonlinear. The probability increasing quickly at first and flattening as
it appraches 1 according to the group size appraches to 50.
